We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.15](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-digitalocean-droplet/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
    module "droplet" {
      source             = "clouddrove/droplet/digitalocean"
      version            = "0.15.0"
      name               = "droplet"
      environment        = "test"
      label_order        = ["environment", "name"]
      droplet_count      = 1
      region             = "bangalore-1"
      ssh_keys           = [module.ssh_key.fingerprint]
      vpc_uuid           = module.vpc.id
      droplet_size       = "nano"
      monitoring         = false
      private_networking = true
      ipv6               = false
      floating_ip        = true
      block_storage_size = 5
      user_data          = file("user-data.sh")
    }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| backups | Boolean controlling if backups are made. Defaults to false. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| block\_storage\_filesystem\_label | Initial filesystem label for the block storage volume. | `string` | `"data"` | no |
| block\_storage\_filesystem\_type | Initial filesystem type (xfs or ext4) for the block storage volume. | `string` | `"xfs"` | no |
| block\_storage\_size | (Required) The size of the block storage volume in GiB. If updated, can only be expanded. | `number` | `0` | no |
| createdby | CreatedBy, eg 'terraform'. | `string` | `"terraform"` | no |
| custom\_image | Whether the image is custom or not (an official image) | `bool` | `false` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `environment`, `name` and `attributes`. | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| droplet\_count | The number of droplets / other resources to create | `number` | `1` | no |
| droplet\_enabled | Flag to control the droplet creation. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| droplet\_size | the size slug of a droplet size | `string` | `"micro"` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| floating\_ip | (Optional) Boolean to control whether floating IPs should be created. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| floating\_ip\_assign | (Optional) Boolean controlling whether floatin IPs should be assigned to instances with Terraform. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| floating\_ip\_count | Number of floating IPs to create. | `string` | `""` | no |
| image\_id | The id of an image to use. | `string` | `""` | no |
| image\_name | The image name or slug to lookup. | `string` | `"ubuntu-20-04-x64"` | no |
| ipv6 | (Optional) Boolean controlling if IPv6 is enabled. Defaults to false. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| monitoring | (Optional) Boolean controlling whether monitoring agent is installed. Defaults to false. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| private\_networking | (Optional) Boolean controlling if private networks are enabled. Defaults to false. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| region | The region to create VPC, like `london-1` , `bangalore-1` ,`newyork-3` `toronto-1`. | `string` | `"bangalore-1"` | no |
| resize\_disk | (Optional) Boolean controlling whether to increase the disk size when resizing a Droplet. It defaults to true. When set to false, only the Droplet's RAM and CPU will be resized. Increasing a Droplet's disk size is a permanent change. Increasing only RAM and CPU is reversible. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| ssh\_keys | (Optional) A list of SSH IDs or fingerprints to enable in the format [12345, 123456]. To retrieve this info, use a tool such as curl with the DigitalOcean API, to retrieve them. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| user\_data | (Optional) A string of the desired User Data for the Droplet. | `string` | `""` | no |
| vpc\_uuid | The ID of the VPC where the Droplet will be located. | `string` | `""` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| id | The ID of the Droplet. |
| name | The name of the Droplet. |
| urn | The uniform resource name of the Droplet. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
